Purpose:
Help build a clean, modular library that uses Ollama to power a dungeon master agent.
The agent should be able to run in a local environment, and should not require internet access.
It should be able to handle complex, open-ended scenarios for one or more players.
It should also be able to handle player input, and should be able to provide feedback to the players.
It should also handle all the NPCs, rules, items, bonuses, and other details of the game.

Rules:
- Use python
- The library should be in the autodm directory
- The library should be modular, and should be able to be used to power a dungeon master agent for D&D

Code:
- Use Ollama (llama3.1:8b) and llama-index or langchain to power the agent
- The agent should always converse in markdown
- Functions and classes should be well-documented in the docstrings
- Always use type hints when possible
